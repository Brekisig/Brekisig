- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's unique chemical composition, including its low moisture content and acidic pH, creates an environment where bacteria and microorganisms cannot thrive, allowing it to last indefinitely under the right conditions.
